# caam

Simple [Blender](https://www.blender.org/about/license/) addon that applies
the first mirror modifier in the stack without destroying it.

You can access it using `object.caam.Copy and Apply
Mirror Modifier` command.  When you install and enable the plugin it does not
create key bindings for this command but you can add your own key binding.

grid-uv-packer is released with [GPL license](./COPYING.txt), same as Blender.
